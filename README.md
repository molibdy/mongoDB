# mongoDB
Learning how noSQL Databases work:

I created a small database in MongoDb with data on fictional users and their profiles. 
I then developed a REST API to familiarize myself with the structure of this type of databases 
and with the queries used to read, add, modify and erase data in them using the mongoose module in Node.js.


In the IMDBmongoApi directory I did a similar exercise, this time creating collections on 
fake movies and professionals, and the REST API to access them.
